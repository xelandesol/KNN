## 📋 Application Overview

### What is KNN?

KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors. It is a simple yet effective algorithm used in data science to classify data points based on their similarity. This application uses KNN to predict whether a customer will leave a telecom service (churn prediction).

### Why Use KNN?

KNN is user-friendly and provides good predictions. It requires minimal configuration, making it suitable for both beginners and experienced users.

## 📊 Features of the Application

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the customer dataset.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes KNN to train on the dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Helps you choose the best `k` value for improved accuracy.
- **Evaluation**: Checks how well the model performs and its accuracy.
- **Exercises**: Engaging tasks to practice what you've learned.
